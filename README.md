# MX-9916

Teardown and Documentation on MX-9916/MX-9648 image intensifier tube used in PVS-5 night vision systems and space shuttle experiments camera.

Have you ever wondered how night vision goggles work? Did you know that if you've ever used night vision devices, you were probably exposing your eyes to 15,000 volts? In this walkthrough of the MX-9916/MX-9648 image intensifier tube made by Galileo Electro-Optics, Inc., I will show you the uses of this type of image intensifier tube and how it converts photons into electricity and then back into light.

So, how does night vision work?

There are three primary forms of night vision:

Image intensification
Active illumination
Thermal imaging
The most common type available to consumers is active illumination, which is commonly referred to as digital night vision. Digital night vision uses a digital camera with no infrared light filter across the sensor. This means that an area can be illuminated with infrared LEDs, and only the camera will be able to see this. This approach is how most security cameras and even Apple's Face ID works (sort of)!

Night vision devices based on image intensification technology, like the MX-9916/MX-9648 tube, work by amplifying available light to enhance visibility in low-light conditions. The tube consists of several key components, including a photocathode, microchannel plate (MCP), and phosphor screen.

The photocathode is the first component that receives incoming light. It absorbs photons and emits electrons as a result of the photoelectric effect. These electrons are then accelerated towards the MCP, which is a thin plate with millions of microscopic channels. Each channel acts as an electron multiplier, amplifying the electron signal as it passes through.

Once the electrons have passed through the MCP, they strike a phosphor screen at the end of the intensifier tube. The phosphor screen converts the amplified electron signal back into visible light, creating a brightened and intensified image that can be observed through an eyepiece or displayed on a screen.

By utilizing this process of converting photons into electricity and then back into light, night vision devices allow users to see in conditions where natural light is limited or absent.
