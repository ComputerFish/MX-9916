# MX-9916
Teardown and Documentation on MX-9916/MX-9648 image intensifier tube used on PVS-5 night vision systems and space shuttle experiments camera.

Ever wonder how night vision goggles work? Did you know, if you've ever used night vision devices you probably held 15,000 volts to your eyes? In this walkthrough of the MX-9916/MX-9648 image intensifier tube made by Gallileo Electro-Optics, Inc. I will show the uses this type of image intensifier tube saw and how it works to convert photons into electricity and then back into light.

# So how does night vision work?

There are three primary forms of night vision:
1. Image intensification
2. Active illumination
3. thermal imaging

The most common type available to consumers is active illumination, this also commonly refered to as digital night vision.
